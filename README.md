# AppBuilder Project

AppBuilder is a low-code app creation platform that lets users visually design, configure, and deploy mobile apps without writing extensive code.  
It uses a React + Tailwind front end, a Node.js/Express backend, and integrates AI to generate layouts and components.  
A live preview keeps edits visible in real time.

- Template Library – Start from pre-built app templates such as e-commerce, education, or fitness  
- Live Preview – Real-time view that mirrors a mobile app  
- AI-Assisted Builder – Generate screens and components from prompts  
- Backend Integration – CRUD APIs for projects, templates, and users  
- User Dashboard – Manage projects and template selections
